Delivery and Logistics Program

This school project was assigned to create a software solution to keep track of and logistically solve delivery constraints on time, available delivery trucks, and optimal route calculations.

In this scenario, I used the Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm, in order to complete all deliveries based on assigned package information for the time of arrival at the hub, required time of delivery, available trucks to deliver packages, and route best suited to deliver all packages on time and within a reasonable total distance traveled that provides significant optimization for minimizing total distance traveled.
